<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Raja, what are we making today?
  <br />
I am a 24 year old Communication Graduate who is obsessed with learning and acquiring new skill, understanding new concepts and connecting with other people.
  <br />
  <br />
My area of expertise resides in Digital Marketing, Personal Branding, Copywriting and I'm also an enthusiast when it comes to coding. Why coding? Why not? It's the foundation of today's technology and it would made zero sense for me not to learn how to code.
Raising high value skill stacks is my lifelong goal as a creator, so that I in turn will be able to help others do the same.
